""" Python based RFID controller for raspberry pi

Python module used to control an RFID scanner connected to a raspberry pi.
It reads the the serial number associated to a magnetic card using a library specially designed to interact with the RC522 RFID scanner. The ports on the scanner should be connected to the RPi as follows:
  
  RC522 Port    |    RPi port
  --------------|--------------
  SDA           |    Pin 24
  SCK           |    Pin 23
  MOSI          |    Pin 19
  MISO          |    Pin 21
  GND           |    Pin 6
  RST           |    Pin 22
  3.3v          |    Pin 1

The library and the instruction on how to use it where taken from 'https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-rfid-rc522/'. Reffer to that page for more info.
